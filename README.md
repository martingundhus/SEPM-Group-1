## How to play
### Objective
 Be the first to connect your stones from one side of the board to the other. The path can twist and turn, but diagonal connections donâ€™t count. All stones in the winning line have to be flat.

### Controls
- WASD or arrow keys to move
- J to place flat stone
- K to place standing stone
- L to pick up and move stack
- O to undo choice of stack to move

### Rules
#### Stones:
- Each player has 21 stones.
- Stones can be placed flat or standing, on an empty tile or on top of flat stones.
- Flat stones placed on top of each other make a stack.
- Stones can never be placed on top of standing stones.

#### Moving Stones:
- You can move stones and stacks if the top stone is yours.
- When moving a stack, you must drop at least one stone per tile moved.
- Stacks move in straight lines.

#### Turns:
- First Move: Each player starts by placing one of their opponent's stones.
- On each turn, players either place a stone or move an existing stone/stack.

#### Winning:
- The game ends when one player connects a line across the board.
- If no line is made, the player with the most top stones wins.
